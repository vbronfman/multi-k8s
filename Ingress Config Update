Ingress Update "this.state.seenIndexes.map is not a function" / 404 errors
updated 7-14-2020

In the upcoming lecture, we will be creating our ingress-service.yaml configuration file. Since the recording of the lecture, there has been an update on how we need to specify some of these rules.

Most recently a change in how ingress-nginx handles regexes is causing 404 errors both locally and on Google Cloud. To resolve this we need to add a new line to the config:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: 'true'
We also need to add a capture group and annotations which will resolve an error later in the course that you might see: TypeError: this.state.seenIndexes.map is not a function that will get thrown in the browser console with a blank white screen.

Lastly, we should update the API version that is being used:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
Four lines need to be updated and one line needs to be added:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
# UPDATE THE API
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-service
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: 'true'
    # ADD THIS LINE ABOVE
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
    # UPDATE THIS LINE ABOVE
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /?(.*)
          # UPDATE THIS LINE ABOVE
            backend:
              serviceName: client-cluster-ip-service
              servicePort: 3000
          - path: /api/?(.*)
          # UPDATE THIS LINE ABOVE
            backend:
              serviceName: server-cluster-ip-service
              servicePort: 5000
