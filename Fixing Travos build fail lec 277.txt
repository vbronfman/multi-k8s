Fix For Failing Travis Builds lecture 277
In the upcoming lecture we will be adding a script to our .travis.yml file. Similar to our previous projects that ran tests using Travis, 
we need to make sure the tests exit after running and don't cause our builds to fail.

Make sure to change this script:

script:
  - docker run USERNAME/docker-react npm test -- --coverage
To use the CI flag and remove coverage:

script:
  - docker run -e CI=true USERNAME/docker-react npm test
