Setting up Ingress with Docker Desktop's Kubernetes
This note is only for students that are using Docker Desktop's built-in Kubernetes. If you are using Minikube, this section does not apply to you and can be skipped.

The following instructions apply to both Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows, even though the docs only list Docker for Mac.

1. Execute the provider-specific command noted here:

https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#docker-for-mac
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.35.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

2. Verify the service was enabled by running the following:

kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

It should show something similar:

ingress-nginx-controller-5cc4589cc8-x7pg2   1/1     Running     0          66s
