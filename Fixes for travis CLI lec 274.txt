Fixes for Travis "iv undefined" or"repository not known" lecture 274
updated 7-9-2020

In the upcoming lecture we will be encrypting a service account file in the Travis container we created in the previous lecture. Travis is currently going through some transitions (.com vs .org), and you may end up getting an error like this when deploying:

iv undefined
The command "openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_0c35eebf403c_key -iv $encrypted_0c35eebf403c_iv -in service-account.json.enc -out service-account.json -d" failed and exited with 1 during .

or, you may get:
repository not known to https://api.travis-ci.org

Depending on which domain your github repo was authorized, you may need to pass a specific flag to both the login and the file encryption:

travis login --com

or

travis login --org

or

travis login --pro

...

travis encrypt-file service-account.json -r USERNAME/REPO --com

or

travis encrypt-file service-account.json -r USERNAME/REPO --org

or

travis encrypt-file service-account.json -r USERNAME/REPO --pro

If you are getting the iv undefined error after a deployment, you'll need to run through the entire encryption process again, instead, following the instructions above.

Important Note: You can also get an iv undefined error if you've passed the wrong repo to the file encryption or passed a repo name with a typo in it.
