If you need to stop the course for any reason remember to shut down this cluster.  Directions for cleaning up the Google Cloud cluster can be found in a lecture at the very end of this course. Here's a direct link to it: https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/t/lecture/11684242?start=0
